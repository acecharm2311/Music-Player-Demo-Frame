# Music-Player-Demo-Frame
Overview: The Music Player Framework in C offers a lightweight and efficient structure that replicates the core features of contemporary music player applications such as Windows Media Player, VLC, and Google Play Music.
The Music Player Framework in C is a compact, efficient solution that captures the core functionality of modern music players like VLC and Windows Media Player. Designed to work with popular audio formats (MP3, AAC, OGG Vorbis), this project demonstrates the power and versatility of the C language. Inspired by classic UNIX systems, it features a minimalist user interface for a focused, distraction-free experience. With built-in error handling, this framework ensures reliable playback and serves as a solid foundation for exploring multimedia application development in C.

1. Project Setup:

  Prerequisites

    •	IDE: Code::Blocks (recommended)
    •	Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
    •	Libraries:

        o	<stdio.h> and <stdlib.h> for file handling and standard input/output
        o	<string.h> for string manipulation
        o	Optional: Additional libraries for audio decoding (if real audio decoding support is added)

  Step 1.1: Project Initialization
    •	Open Code::Blocks IDE.
    •	Create a new project:
      o	Select Console Application.
      o	Choose C as the programming language.
      o	Set the project name and save the project in a designated folder.
 
  Step 1.2: Project Structure
    •	Create directories for organizing files:
      o	src/ - for source files
      o	include/ - for header files
      o	audio/ - for storing sample audio files

2. Core Modules and Architecture
  The project is organized into separate modules for readability and maintainability.

   Step 2.1: Core Modules
    •	main.c: Handles the main program flow and user interactions.
    •	player.c and player.h: Core functionalities of the music player (e.g., play, pause, stop).
    •	file_manager.c and file_manager.h: Manages audio files, loading file paths, and verifying file formats.
    •	ui.c and ui.h: Manages the user interface, displaying options and receiving user input.

3. File Handling and Audio Support
  This framework handles locally stored audio files in common formats like MP3, AAC, and OGG Vorbis. Since actual decoding of audio formats is complex, this project simulates loading and playback functionality.
   Step 3.1: Simulating Audio Playback
    •	Load Audio File: Use file_manager.c to load a file, verifying if it matches one of the supported formats by checking the file extension.
    •	Simulated Playback: Implement placeholder functions for play, pause, and stop within player.c, which can print messages to simulate playback.

4. User Interface (UI) Design
  Step 4.1: Basic UI Layout
    Design a text-based interface using standard output functions (printf). The UI includes options such as:
      1.	Play Song
      2.	Pause Song
      3.	Stop Song
      4.	Load Another Song
      5.	Exit
  Step 4.2: Menu Implementation
    •	In ui.c, implement a loop that displays the main menu and processes user inputs.

5. Runtime Exception Handling
  To make the program robust, handle potential errors, such as missing files or unsupported formats.
  Step 5.1: Error Handling Functions
    Define error handling functions in error_handling.c to:
    •	Check File Existence: Confirm if the audio file exists before attempting to load it.
    •	Validate Format: Ensure only supported formats are loaded.
    •	Handle User Input Errors: Verify valid input for menu selections.
________________________________________________________________________________


6. Compilation and Execution
  Step 6.1: Compile the Program
    •	Use Code::Blocks to build the project by selecting Build > Build and Run.
    •	Check for any compilation errors and resolve them if necessary.
  Step 6.2: Run the Program
    •	Once compiled successfully, the program can be executed in a console.
    •	Test each function (play, pause, stop, load) to ensure they operate as expected.

7. Future Enhancements
  Potential future improvements:
    •	Audio Decoding Integration: Integrate libraries like libmp3lame or libogg for actual playback of supported audio formats.
    •	Playlist Support: Allow users to create and manage playlists.
    •	Advanced UI Options: Implement a more interactive UI with additional playback features.
    •	Cross-Platform Support: Extend compatibility to other systems or environments.
